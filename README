------------------------------------------------------------------------
to install pysoso:

  1. run a python interpreter (2.6+) from the pysoso directory.
     execute the following commands to create the sqlite3 db:

       import pysoso
       pysoso.init_db()

  2. edit settings.py to point to the full path of your db file.
     edit $SCRIPT_ROOT in static/pysoso.js to point to the top-level
     URL that your application will reside within.

  3. run 'python pysoso.py' to start the server.
     alternatively, edit pysoso.wsgi and configure your webserver to
     use this WSGI file as detailed in the Flask documentation.

  4. to update the feeds database, you'll need to schedule the script
     bin/feed-update-all.py to execute regularly. first time, try running
     it manually; your feeds' last-modified times should update accordingly.
     when adding a crontab entry, use the '-q' flag for silent operation.
